    fullDescription: `Based in Maida Vale this project involved reconfiguring a top floor flat within a six storey grade II listed building. The redevelopment included a mezzanine, forming a new opening in the mansard roof and demolishing walls below the mezzanine level to create an open living space. 

Structural elements introduced into the project consisted mainly of timber design to minimise associated costs for the client. The project architecture and management were successfully led by XAMI Architects.

As a Grade II listed building, our engineering approach required careful consideration of the property's heritage features while implementing modern structural solutions. Working closely with conservation officers and the architects, we developed timber structural solutions that were sympathetic to the building's character while fulfilling the client's requirements for open plan living.

The mezzanine design utilized lightweight timber construction techniques that minimized load impact on the existing structure, while the new roof opening was engineered to maintain structural integrity and comply with conservation guidelines. Our timber-focused approach not only reduced costs but also aligned with sustainable building practices and heritage conservation principles.`

    fullDescription: `Based in South West London, this property required a comprehensive rear extension and internal refurbishment. The project architecture and management were successfully led by REES Architects, with our structural engineering team providing critical support throughout the development process.

The technically challenging rear extension design incorporated sophisticated structural elements including lateral stabilisation of the existing walls and strategic support of the structure above. Our engineers implemented a Universal Column (UC) steel beam solution that ensured structural integrity while maintaining the architect's aesthetic vision.

This residential transformation also featured specialized foundation engineering for a sunken seating area, which necessitated the design of a robust retaining wall system with detailed bar bending schedules. Our structural calculations accounted for soil pressure and drainage requirements, ensuring long-term stability and compliance with building regulations.

Throughout the project, we collaborated closely with the architects and contractors to overcome site-specific challenges and deliver engineering solutions that balanced technical requirements with design aspirations. The successful completion of this project demonstrates our expertise in residential structural engineering and our commitment to realizing complex architectural visions through innovative structural design.`
