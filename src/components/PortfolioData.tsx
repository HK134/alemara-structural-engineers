    fullDescription: `This bespoke design was commissioned as part of the new exhibition at the New Bond Street Halcyon Gallery. We were involved in creating the structural support for the beautiful Persian Pergola ceiling as part of the Chihuly Now exhibition, led by master artist Dale Chihuly. 

The bespoke structural design to support the ceiling was required to create maximum space and ensure the safety of visitors while they walk beneath the ceiling or when they stop to take photos of the immersive canopy of colour, form and light.

Our engineering team worked closely with the gallery curators and installation specialists to design a support structure that would:

1. Provide adequate strength to hold the delicate glass artwork safely
2. Remain visually unobtrusive to maintain the artistic integrity of the installation
3. Meet all safety requirements for public exhibition spaces
4. Allow for the unique lighting conditions needed to showcase the vibrant colors and forms

This project demonstrates our ability to combine technical structural engineering with sensitive artistic requirements, creating a solution that prioritizes both safety and aesthetics in a high-profile cultural venue.`

    fullDescription: `This property required a full internal refurbishment. The original condition was poor with numerous structural issues, including sloping floors and fragile timber supports. We provided a very cost-effective timber design solution to remedy the problems and allow for openings within load bearing walls to create an open plan living space. The architecture and project management were successfully led by REES Architects.

Our structural engineering team conducted a comprehensive assessment of the property's condition, identifying critical weaknesses in the floor joists and wall supports. The challenge was to create an open, contemporary living space while addressing the underlying structural deficiencies without exceeding the client's budget.

By implementing an innovative timber reinforcement system, we were able to level the floors and strengthen the existing structure without the higher costs associated with steel beam installations. Our design incorporated laminated timber beams positioned strategically to distribute loads effectively, allowing for the safe removal of internal walls.

The successful completion of this project demonstrates our expertise in finding cost-efficient structural solutions for period properties while enabling modern, open-plan living arrangements. The finished home now features a bright, flowing space with strengthened floors and walls that will maintain their structural integrity for decades to come.`

    fullDescription: `Based in Maida Vale this project involved reconfiguring a top floor flat within a six storey grade II listed building. The redevelopment included a mezzanine, forming a new opening in the mansard roof and demolishing walls below the mezzanine level to create an open living space. 

Structural elements introduced into the project consisted mainly of timber design to minimise associated costs for the client. The project architecture and management were successfully led by XAMI Architects.

As a Grade II listed building, our engineering approach required careful consideration of the property's heritage features while implementing modern structural solutions. Working closely with conservation officers and the architects, we developed timber structural solutions that were sympathetic to the building's character while fulfilling the client's requirements for open plan living.

The mezzanine design utilized lightweight timber construction techniques that minimized load impact on the existing structure, while the new roof opening was engineered to maintain structural integrity and comply with conservation guidelines. Our timber-focused approach not only reduced costs but also aligned with sustainable building practices and heritage conservation principles.`

    fullDescription: `A 3,000ft² carpet warehouse was transformed into a 500-capacity club space and bar. The concept focused on providing the area with the best possible acoustics.

The main area of the club was designed as a standalone structure in an internal space, so the entire floor was lifted from the ground and dampeners were used to distance it from the floor below.

This meant that none of the structure was allowed to rely on the external walls, which meant very little outside noise came in and less noise escaped, providing the perfect environment for recording studios and the club.

Our structural engineering solutions included:

1. Custom-designed acoustic isolation systems
2. Floating floor construction with vibration dampening mechanisms
3. Independent structural framework that avoided load-bearing on exterior walls
4. Sound-absorbing materials integration
5. Strategic placement of support columns to maximize open space while maintaining structural integrity

The unique challenges of this project required innovative approaches to structural design while ensuring compliance with both building safety regulations and acoustic performance standards. The resulting space successfully combines technical excellence with a striking visual aesthetic.`

    fullDescription: `Based in South West London, this property required a comprehensive rear extension and internal refurbishment. The project architecture and management were successfully led by REES Architects, with our structural engineering team providing critical support throughout the development process.

The technically challenging rear extension design incorporated sophisticated structural elements including lateral stabilisation of the existing walls and strategic support of the structure above. Our engineers implemented a Universal Column (UC) steel beam solution that ensured structural integrity while maintaining the architect's aesthetic vision.

This residential transformation also featured specialized foundation engineering for a sunken seating area, which necessitated the design of a robust retaining wall system with detailed bar bending schedules. Our structural calculations accounted for soil pressure and drainage requirements, ensuring long-term stability and compliance with building regulations.

Throughout the project, we collaborated closely with the architects and contractors to overcome site-specific challenges and deliver engineering solutions that balanced technical requirements with design aspirations. The successful completion of this project demonstrates our expertise in residential structural engineering and our commitment to realizing complex architectural visions through innovative structural design.`
