    fullDescription: `Rees + Lee Architects had successfully obtained planning approval from Hammersmith & Fulham Council for this intricate basement extension and internal layout restructuring scheme in the Barons Court conservation area. The unique project proposed a zinc clad box below a new roof terrace requiring a box frame design.

The project also included new foundations, underpinning of garden walls and staircase. Prior to providing a final structural package, we visited the site to inspect the existing structure and discuss our ideas with the architect and the client. Following the site visit, a schematic structural design was provided, and once confirmed, the final full package was released.

The extension incorporated modern design elements while preserving the character of this Victorian property. The kitchen features a white marble island contrasting with navy blue cabinetry, while original decorative ceiling moldings were preserved throughout the renovation. The project successfully blends contemporary living spaces with the building's historic features.`
