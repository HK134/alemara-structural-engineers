    fullDescription: `A 3,000ft² carpet warehouse was transformed into a 500-capacity club space and bar. The concept focused on providing the area with the best possible acoustics.

The main area of the club was designed as a standalone structure in an internal space, so the entire floor was lifted from the ground and dampeners were used to distance it from the floor below.

This meant that none of the structure was allowed to rely on the external walls, which meant very little outside noise came in and less noise escaped, providing the perfect environment for recording studios and the club.

Our structural engineering solutions included:

1. Custom-designed acoustic isolation systems
2. Floating floor construction with vibration dampening mechanisms
3. Independent structural framework that avoided load-bearing on exterior walls
4. Sound-absorbing materials integration
5. Strategic placement of support columns to maximize open space while maintaining structural integrity

The unique challenges of this project required innovative approaches to structural design while ensuring compliance with both building safety regulations and acoustic performance standards. The resulting space successfully combines technical excellence with a striking visual aesthetic.`
