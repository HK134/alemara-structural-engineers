    fullDescription: `Our structural engineering team provided critical support for the design and construction of The Shard, Western Europe's tallest building. We worked closely with the architectural team to optimize the structural design, ensuring stability and efficiency while meeting the aesthetic goals of the project.

Key aspects of our involvement included:
1. Finite element analysis to model structural behavior under various loading conditions
2. Design of high-strength concrete core and steel frame
3. Optimization of foundation design to minimize settlement
4. Wind tunnel testing to assess aerodynamic performance
5. On-site construction support and quality control

This landmark project required innovative engineering solutions to overcome the challenges of building a super-tall structure in a dense urban environment. Our work helped ensure the Shard's structural integrity and long-term durability.`

    fullDescription: `The Battersea Power Station project involved the structural assessment and refurbishment of the iconic building, transforming it into a mixed-use commercial and residential space. Our team conducted a thorough investigation of the existing structure to determine its condition and load-bearing capacity.

Key aspects of our work included:
1. Detailed condition assessment of all structural elements
2. Finite element analysis to model structural behavior under new loading conditions
3. Design of reinforcement and repair strategies for damaged elements
4. Design of new structural elements to support the new building functions
5. On-site construction support and quality control

This complex project required a deep understanding of historic building materials and construction techniques. Our work helped ensure the structural integrity of the building while preserving its architectural heritage.`
