    fullDescription: `Based in South West London, this property required a comprehensive rear extension and internal refurbishment. The project architecture and management were successfully led by REES Architects, with our structural engineering team providing critical support throughout the development process.

The technically challenging rear extension design incorporated sophisticated structural elements including lateral stabilisation of the existing walls and strategic support of the structure above. Our engineers implemented a Universal Column (UC) steel beam solution that ensured structural integrity while maintaining the architect's aesthetic vision.

This residential transformation also featured specialized foundation engineering for a sunken seating area, which necessitated the design of a robust retaining wall system with detailed bar bending schedules. Our structural calculations accounted for soil pressure and drainage requirements, ensuring long-term stability and compliance with building regulations.

Throughout the project, we collaborated closely with the architects and contractors to overcome site-specific challenges and deliver engineering solutions that balanced technical requirements with design aspirations. The successful completion of this project demonstrates our expertise in residential structural engineering and our commitment to realizing complex architectural visions through innovative structural design.`
