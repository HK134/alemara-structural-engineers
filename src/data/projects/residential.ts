    fullDescription: `Located in the heart of London, on the site of Count Rumford's Brompton Road residence, Cheval Place has a long history of innovation, experimentation and Victorian practicality.

The proposal aims to preserve the character of the historic mews property while providing a modern aesthetic which pays homage to the original form. Additionally, a discreet contemporary extension ensures that the proposed duplex apartments enjoy high-quality, spacious city centre living and benefit from private outdoor space.

Our structural engineering work included:

1. Careful assessment of the existing structure to determine load-bearing capabilities
2. Design of steel reinforcements for the additional floor while maintaining the historic facade
3. Engineering solutions for internal reconfigurations that preserved the external character
4. Specialized foundation work to accommodate modern amenities
5. Rooftop terrace structural support systems with minimal visual impact

This challenging project required close collaboration with conservation specialists and architects to balance modernization with heritage preservation. The successful result demonstrates our expertise in sensitive structural interventions within historically significant properties.`

    fullDescription: `This property required a full internal refurbishment. The original condition was poor with numerous structural issues, including sloping floors and fragile timber supports. We provided a very cost-effective timber design solution to remedy the problems and allow for openings within load bearing walls to create an open plan living space. The architecture and project management were successfully led by REES Architects.

Our structural engineering team conducted a comprehensive assessment of the property's condition, identifying critical weaknesses in the floor joists and wall supports. The challenge was to create an open, contemporary living space while addressing the underlying structural deficiencies without exceeding the client's budget.

By implementing an innovative timber reinforcement system, we were able to level the floors and strengthen the existing structure without the higher costs associated with steel beam installations. Our design incorporated laminated timber beams positioned strategically to distribute loads effectively, allowing for the safe removal of internal walls.

The successful completion of this project demonstrates our expertise in finding cost-efficient structural solutions for period properties while enabling modern, open-plan living arrangements. The finished home now features a bright, flowing space with strengthened floors and walls that will maintain their structural integrity for decades to come.`

    fullDescription: `Based in Maida Vale this project involved reconfiguring a top floor flat within a six storey grade II listed building. The redevelopment included a mezzanine, forming a new opening in the mansard roof and demolishing walls below the mezzanine level to create an open living space. 

Structural elements introduced into the project consisted mainly of timber design to minimise associated costs for the client. The project architecture and management were successfully led by XAMI Architects.

As a Grade II listed building, our engineering approach required careful consideration of the property's heritage features while implementing modern structural solutions. Working closely with conservation officers and the architects, we developed timber structural solutions that were sympathetic to the building's character while fulfilling the client's requirements for open plan living.

The mezzanine design utilized lightweight timber construction techniques that minimized load impact on the existing structure, while the new roof opening was engineered to maintain structural integrity and comply with conservation guidelines. Our timber-focused approach not only reduced costs but also aligned with sustainable building practices and heritage conservation principles.`
